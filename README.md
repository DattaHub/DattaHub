I am an Associate Professor of Statistics at Virginia Tech, where I work on Bayesian methods for high-dimensional data. My research focuses on shrinkage, sparse signal recovery, and graphical models, with applications in fields like astronomy, genomics, neuroscience, and public policy. I was honored to receive the NSF CAREER Award in 2025 and the Dayanand Naik Award from the Virginia Chapter of the ASA in 2023.
