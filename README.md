My name is Jyotishka Datta. I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at the Virginia Tech University.

My research interest spans Bayesian methodology and theory for structured high-dimensional data. I have contributed to the area of multiple testing, shrinkage estimation, sparse signal recovery, nonparametric Bayes, bioinformatics, and default Bayes. Recent applications include next-gen sequencing studies, auditory neuroscience, ecology and crime forecasting.
