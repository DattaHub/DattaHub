My name is Jyotishka Datta. I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University).

My research interest spans Bayesian methodology and theory for structured, often high-dimensional data. I have contributed to the areas of global-local priors, multiple testing, shrinkage estimation, sparse signal recovery, nonparametric Bayes, bioinformatics, and default Bayes. Recent applications include next-gen sequencing studies, auditory neuroscience, ecology and crime forecasting.
